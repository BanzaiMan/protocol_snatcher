Mail URL Rewriter (MURLR)

MURLR is a Mail.app plugin which lets you modify URLs before passing it to the
OS.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT
==============================================================================
Mac OS X Leopard.
(It might be possible to make it work on Tiger, but I have no access to Tiger
at this time.)


INSTALL
==============================================================================
* Create ~/Library/Mail/Bundles if it does not exist already.
* Put the Bundle there.
* Type the following commands in the Terminal:
  defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles YES
  defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 3
* Restart Mail.app.

USAGE
==============================================================================
Online help is available from the MURLR Preferences pane.

KNOWN ISSUES
==============================================================================
* If the volume you specify with the rule is not available when a match
happens, it may take a few minutes before Mail.app returns with an error.

IMPROVEMENT POSSIBILITIES
==============================================================================
* Import/Export rules.
* Asynchronous volume mount.
* Better alert in case something goes wrong during our handling of the URL.
